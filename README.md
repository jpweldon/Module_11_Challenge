# Module_11_Challenge

# Search Traffic and Growth at MercadoLibre

---

## Introduction:

The premise of this project is the scenario that I am a growth analyst at MercadoLibre. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I have been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, I want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

I have created a Jupyter notebook that contains data preperation, analysis, and visualizations for the time series data that the company needs to understand. I have used text and comments to document my findings, and have answered relevant questions.
